/* How should hardware flow-control be implemented?  The easiest and
   most general approach is to place the responsibility on the user
   and have a function to pause/resume data transmission.  This might
   not be as fine-grained as having the TX ISR check.  This would also
   require that writes are non-blocking otherwise the user does not
   get a chance to monitor the flow-control signals.

   What about half-duplex operation, say for IRDA?  Do we really need
   to disable the receiver when transmitting?  With the receiver
   enabled we will pick up what we are sending, in theory.  For some
   applications it is necessary to disable the transmitter buffer to
   avoid bus conflict.  While most processors have an interrupt when the
   transmitter finishes, for generality, it is easier to poll.
