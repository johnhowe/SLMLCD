/* These routines are for sequencing the flashing of a LED or beeping
   a piezo tweeter.  Each pattern is 16 bits in length.  The current
   LSB of a pattern determines whether the LED should be lit.  The
   pattern is then shifted to the right.  When it is zero, it is
   reloaded.  Thus the patterns are repeating and the length of the
   sequence can be fewer than 16 bits.

   For example,
     0bxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1 will keep a LED on
     0b0000000000000010 will toggle the LED every period
     0b0000000000001100 will toggle the LED every second period
     0b0000000011110000 will toggle the LED every fourth period
     0b1111111100000000 will toggle the LED every eighth period
     0x1010101010000000 will flash the LED 5 times out of 16 periods
