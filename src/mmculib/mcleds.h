/* These routines are designed for multiplexing multiple colour LEDs
   with separate red, green, and blue cathodes.  The strategy used
   here is to continuously sequence the R, G, and B cathodes while the
   anodes are driven for a portion of each R, G, B period to control
   the proportion of red, blue, and green comprising each colour
   determined by a colourmap.

   For example, let's assume that the cathodes are asserted for 10
   clocks and we want a colour comprised of 6/10 red, 5/10 green, and
   8/10 blue we would generate the following timing sequence, where X
   denotes when a signal is asserted:

   R: XXXXXXXXXX                    XXXXXXXXXX
   G:           XXXXXXXXXX                    XXXXXXXXXX
   B:                     XXXXXXXXXX
   A: XXXXXX    XXXXX     XXXXXXXX  XXXXXX    XXXXX
