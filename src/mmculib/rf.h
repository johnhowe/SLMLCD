   Currently only the master can initiate a transmission.  A slave
   acknowledges the transmission by sending an acknowledge packet
   to the well known address of the master on the channel that
   the master transmitted on.

   To allow arbitrary packet transmission between nodes it will be
   necessary to add the source address to each packet.  This could
   just be the last byte of the address.

   Initially the slaves listen on the well known slave broadcast
   address on the broadcast channel.  The master enumerates them by
   sending an enumerate message; the slaves respond sending a unique
   identifier until the master acknowledges receipt of the identifier
   with the address to use.  */
