A controller for a transparent LCD to be used as part of a spatial light 
modulator (SLM). This SLM will be used to emulate amplitude and phase 
aberrations observed in light passing through the Earth's atmosphere.

The display is a 240x160 pixel graphical LCD with 32 shades of gray. This will 
be updated with frames from a PC at 50Hz. Development is on an AT91SAM7S256 
microcontroller.
