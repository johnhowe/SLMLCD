The main objective of this project is to design and implement a controller for
a transparent LCD to be used as part of a spatial light modulator (SLM).  This
will be used to emulate amplitude and phase aberrations observed in light
passing through the Earth's atmosphere.

The display to be used is a 240x160 pixel graphical LCD with 32 shades of gray.
The intention is to refresh this LCD at 50Hz, although this may be limited by
the maximum throughput of the I2C protocol supported by the LCD. Frames will be
sent from a PC to the microcontroller, again at the refresh rate of 50Hz.

An AT91SAM7S256 microcontroller has been chosen as it should be able to support
this bandwidth and be able to handle any necessary image decoding.
